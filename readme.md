### Configure and extend

#### Toolbars and buttons

You can add more buttons any of the toolbars with the following filters:

* `fee_toolbar_caret` for the caret,
* `fee_toolbar_inline` for normal selections,
* `fee_toolbar_block` for block selections.

See the [Codex page](https://codex.wordpress.org/TinyMCE_Custom_Buttons) and [TinyMCE docs](https://www.tinymce.com/docs/advanced/editor-control-identifiers/#toolbarcontrols) for more information about adding toolbar buttons with TinyMCE.

#### Custom Post Types Support

    add_post_type_support( 'page', 'front-end-editor' );

Note that this may change in the future. Please make sure you also support the [REST API](http://v2.wp-api.org/extending/custom-content-types/).

#### Disable

If you'd like to disable the editor for certain posts, you can use the `supports_fee` filter.

    // Disable for the post with ID 1.
    add_filter('supports_fee', function($supports, $post) {
      return $post->ID !== 1;
    }, 10, 2);
